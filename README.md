Welcome to the **Terraform AWS ECS Fullstack App** repository! This project showcases a full-stack Task Manager application built with a containerized Node.js backend and a MySQL database. The application leverages AWS services such as RDS and ECS Fargate, all managed through Terraform for infrastructure as code.

## üöÄ Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: The application is designed with microservices in mind, allowing for scalable and maintainable code.
- **Containerization**: Built using Docker, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.
- **AWS Integration**: Utilizes AWS RDS for database management and ECS Fargate for container orchestration.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform is used to manage and provision all infrastructure components, making deployments repeatable and efficient.

## üì¶ Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/YaziiMilo/terraform-aws-ecs-fullstack-app/releases). Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the release notes to execute the necessary setup.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or later
- **Docker**: For containerization
- **Terraform**: Version 1.0 or later
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with appropriate permissions

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YaziiMilo/terraform-aws-ecs-fullstack-app.git
   cd terraform-aws-ecs-fullstack-app
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Images**:

   Navigate to the appropriate directories and build the Docker images.

   ```bash
   docker build -t task-manager-backend ./backend
   docker build -t task-manager-frontend ./frontend
   ```

3. **Configure Terraform**:

   Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with your AWS credentials and desired configurations.

4. **Initialize Terraform**:

   Run the following command to initialize Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

5. **Apply Terraform Configuration**:

   Execute the following command to provision the infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:

   Once the infrastructure is set up, you can access the application using the provided URL in the output of the Terraform apply command.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: For building the backend service.
- **Express.js**: To handle API requests.
- **MySQL**: As the database solution, hosted on AWS RDS.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Terraform**: For managing AWS infrastructure.
- **AWS ECS Fargate**: For running containers without managing servers.

## üåê Architecture Overview

The application follows a microservices architecture, which allows each component to scale independently. Below is a simplified architecture diagram:

### Components

1. **Frontend**: A React application that interacts with the backend API.
2. **Backend**: A Node.js service that handles business logic and data processing.
3. **Database**: MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS for persistent storage.

## üîÑ Continuous Integration and Deployment

The project can be integrated with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment. Here‚Äôs a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build Docker images
        run: |
          docker build -t task-manager-backend ./backend
          docker build -t task-manager-frontend ./frontend

      - name: Deploy with Terraform
        run: |
          cd terraform
          terraform init
          terraform apply -auto-approve
```
